A simple ember.js app using gulp for the client side build step

**ATTN: non working code**

At this time the gulp module used to transpile from ES6
does not yet have a way to prefix the modules. This is required
to get this ember example working. Until the issue below is corrected
this will be a non working example.

To run the ember.js app locally

    npm install
    export PATH="./node_modules/.bin:$PATH"

    gulp local
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000

    visit http://localhost:3000 to see the running app


To run the javascript tests

    npm install
    export PATH="./node_modules/.bin:$PATH"

    gulp test
